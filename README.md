# Half Baked Registration Add Feature

### Learning Objectives

- Connect Supabase's auth methods to a React form to provide Sign In/Up support
- Use React state & Supabase's auth methods to create protected routes in React router which are only available to authenticated users

### Description

This app is solely focused on creating registration. There should be a single route (the "/" root or home page). When the user is not authenticated, the user should see sign in and sign up forms. When the user is authenticated, they should something else...anything else. A meme, a joke, a You Tube video.
