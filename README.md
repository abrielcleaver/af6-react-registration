- Netlify Link -> https://abriels-registration.netlify.app/

### Learning Objectives

- Connect Supabase's auth methods to a React form to provide Sign In/Up support
- Use React state & Supabase's auth methods to create protected routes in React router which are only available to authenticated users

### Description

This app is solely focused on creating registration. There is a single route ("/" root or home page). When the user is not authenticated, the user should see sign in and sign up forms. When the user is authenticated, they will see something else.. a meme, a joke, a YouTube video, etc.
